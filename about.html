            <h2>The Problem: The Interaction Gap</h2>
            <p>Reaction content is one of the most dominant genres on YouTube. Millions of viewers love watching the authentic and entertaining reactions of their favorite creators to videos, music, or trailers. But behind this trend lies a fundamental problem: the <strong>interaction gap</strong>.</p>
            <p>When you watch a reaction video, your engagement—likes, comments, subscriptions, and valuable watch time—goes almost exclusively to the reaction creator. The original artist or creator, whose hard work, creativity, and talent form the very basis of the reaction, often remains invisible and receives no credit. The feedback loop is broken.</p>
